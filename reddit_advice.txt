Tips on how to roast better
You are made up by how u react to someone making fun of u as a joke/ roast. Problem is idk how to react when someone roasts me except by trying to somewhat roast them back or say ‚Äústfu‚Äù.

In turn i feel like a beta. How do i not feel like a beta while showing them tht i am someone u can joke w?

I‚Äôm trying to work on this myself too as I want to try to be a more fun person to talk to. I‚Äôve always just laughed along or deny whatever they say. And I think I can understand that something doesn‚Äôt feel right lol.

But from observing the way my friends talk, when they roast each other they sound very light hearted as if they are laughing and smiling as they say it. Another thing to try is to mirror the way your friends say their joke, like mirror their demeanor and attitude? It‚Äôs hard to come up with something to roast them back so you‚Äôre at least doing a better job than me lol.

Practice! The black community roasted for fun for centuries, watch us do it. But when you‚Äôre not being roasted, make up roasts. Roast people in your head. Watch Black comedians deal with hecklers on YouTube.

Most importantly, work On your delivery! Because sometimes funny people are funny because of how they say it - not what they say.

I usually try to enjoy the roast, so I either laugh with them or add some more "roasting" to myself. Some examples:
Them: "Your arm looks like you masturbate a lot." | Answer: "Nah, I used to work as a crane.
"Them: "You're pretty hostile today, is it that time of the month?" (I'm a guy) | Answer: "Yeah, you should write down the date so you'll know it from now on."

Play their game, but make sure that you enjoy it too. This is my approach. Also, it's very important how you say these things, emotion can be expressed through voice tone, so they'll notice if you're pissed even if you try not to show it. Hope this helps.

Edit: I want to add something, be brave enough to be vulnerable and everything should be better than trying to maintain a (fake) invulnerable attitude.

The easiest thing you can do is agree with what they say and add details to exaggerate it.

Examples: Friend: ‚ÄúDude you smell like ass‚Äù You: ‚ÄúI know, I took up a new hobby shoveling horse shit‚Äù

Friend: ‚Äúwhat are you wearing? You look homeless‚Äù You: ‚Äúthanks, my mom made this for me, do you like it?‚Äù Friend: ‚Äúseriously?‚Äù You: ‚Äúyeah, she used my dogs fur‚Ä¶ it just died‚Äù

It usually leaves them laughing and/or saying what the hell man

Edit: you want to communicate this in a light hearted manner. You don‚Äôt want to get emotionally tied to what the other person has said. It shouldn‚Äôt take long for a response either, just go for the first thing that comes to mind and it will become easier for you with time. Sometimes a quick ‚Äúthank you, I‚Äôm glad you noticed‚Äù works fine

I like to reply with either over the top compliments to cross their wires or my two favorite go to's: "You're the type to pour the milk and then the cereal," and "Keep talking and I'm gonna teach your kids how to ride a bike."

I honestly never figured this out, I have two settings socially when roasted:

Sweet and polite water off a ducks back

Take a butchering knife and make a upside down U shaped slice from kneecap to groin to kneecap and drain the entire body of blood as efficiently as possible

Sooooo.... When I've reached my limit of being nice I'm completely insane and people never see it coming
